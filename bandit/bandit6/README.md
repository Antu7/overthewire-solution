The old man was right. We don't have permission to read files.

````
we only have one file to get access that is our flag. But what if there is too much file that we have permission?
that is a question for next level ;)
```
bandit6@bandit:~$ cat /var/lib/dpkg/info/bandit7.password
HKBPTKQnIay4Fw76bEy8PVxKEDQRKTzs
```

So `HKBPTKQnIay4Fw76bEy8PVxKEDQRKTzs` is our password to get access into next level
